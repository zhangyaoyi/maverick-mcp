## Claude Desktop Setup

### Connection Methods

**✅ RECOMMENDED**: Claude Desktop works best with the **SSE endpoint via mcp-remote bridge**. This configuration has been tested and **prevents tools from disappearing** after initial connection.

#### Method A: SSE Server with mcp-remote Bridge (Recommended - Stable)

This is the **tested and proven method for Claude Desktop** - provides stable tool registration:

1. **Start the SSE server**:
   ```bash
   make dev  # Runs SSE server on port 8003
   ```

2. **Configure with mcp-remote bridge**:
   Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "maverick-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Why This Configuration Works Best**:
- ✅ **Prevents Tool Disappearing**: Tools remain available throughout your session
- ✅ **Stable Connection**: SSE transport provides consistent communication
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: Maintains connection state for complex analysis workflows
- ✅ **All 35+ Tools Available**: Reliable access to all financial and research tools
- ✅ **Tested and Confirmed**: This exact configuration has been verified to work
- ✅ **No Trailing Slash Issues**: Server automatically handles both `/sse` and `/sse/` paths

#### Method B: HTTP Streamable Server with mcp-remote Bridge (Alternative)
   
1. **Start the HTTP Streamable server**:
   ```bash
   make dev  # Runs HTTP streamable server on port 8003
   ```

2. **Configure with mcp-remote bridge**:
   Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "maverick-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/mcp/"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Uses HTTP Streamable transport
- ✅ Alternative to SSE endpoint
- ✅ Supports remote access

#### Method C: Remote via Claude.ai (Alternative)
   
   For native remote server support, use [Claude.ai web interface](https://claude.ai/settings/integrations) instead of Claude Desktop.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** and test with: "Show me technical analysis for AAPL"

### Other Popular MCP Clients

> ⚠️ **Critical Transport Warning**: MCP clients have specific transport limitations. Using incorrect configurations will cause connection failures. Always verify which transports your client supports.

#### Transport Compatibility Matrix

| MCP Client           | STDIO | HTTP | SSE | Optimal Method                                |
|----------------------|-------|------|-----|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Claude Desktop**   | ❌    | ❌   | ✅  | **SSE via mcp-remote** (stable, tested)      |
| **Cursor IDE**       | ✅    | ❌   | ✅  | SSE and STDIO supported                       |
| **Claude Code CLI**  | ✅    | ✅   | ✅  | All transports supported                      |
| **Continue.dev**     | ✅    | ❌   | ✅  | SSE and STDIO supported                       |

#### Claude Desktop (Most Commonly Used)

**✅ TESTED CONFIGURATION**: Use SSE endpoint with mcp-remote bridge - prevents tools from disappearing and ensures stable connection.

**Configuration Location:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**SSE Connection with mcp-remote (Tested and Stable):**

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   make dev  # Starts SSE server on port 8003
   ```

2. Configure Claude Desktop:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "maverick-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Important**: This exact configuration has been tested and confirmed to prevent the common issue where tools appear initially but then disappear from Claude Desktop. The server now accepts both `/sse` and `/sse/` paths without redirects.

**Restart Required:** Always restart Claude Desktop after config changes.

#### Cursor IDE - SSE and STDIO Support

**Option 1: Direct SSE (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8003/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Location:** Cursor → Settings → MCP Servers

#### Claude Code CLI - Full Transport Support

**SSE Transport (Recommended):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse maverick-mcp http://localhost:8003/sse
```

**HTTP Transport (Alternative):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http maverick-mcp http://localhost:8003/mcp/
```

**STDIO Transport (Development only):**
```bash
claude mcp add maverick-mcp uv run python -m maverick_mcp.api.server --transport stdio
```

#### Continue.dev - SSE and STDIO Support

**Option 1: Direct SSE (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8003/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: SSE via mcp-remote (Alternative):**
```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "modelContextProtocolServer": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/sse"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Location:** `~/.continue/config.json`

#### Windsurf IDE - SSE and STDIO Support

**Option 1: Direct SSE (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8003/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: SSE via mcp-remote (Alternative):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maverick-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8003/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Location:** Windsurf → Settings → Advanced Settings → MCP Servers

### How It Works

**Connection Architecture:**
- **STDIO Mode (Optimal for Claude Desktop)**: Direct subprocess communication - fastest, most reliable
- **Streamable-HTTP Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8003/` - For remote access via mcp-remote bridge
- **SSE Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8003/sse` - For other clients with native SSE support (accepts both `/sse` and `/sse/`)

> **Key Finding**: Direct STDIO is the optimal transport for Claude Desktop. HTTP/SSE require the mcp-remote bridge tool, adding latency and complexity. SSE is particularly problematic as it's incompatible with mcp-remote (GET vs POST mismatch).

**Transport Limitations by Client:**
- **Claude Desktop**: STDIO-only, cannot directly connect to HTTP/SSE
- **Most Other Clients**: Support STDIO + SSE (but not HTTP)
- **Claude Code CLI**: Full transport support (STDIO, HTTP, SSE)

**mcp-remote Bridge Tool:**
- **Purpose**: Converts STDIO client calls to HTTP/SSE server requests
- **Why Needed**: Bridges the gap between STDIO-only clients and HTTP/SSE servers
- **Connection Flow**: Client (STDIO) ↔ mcp-remote ↔ HTTP/SSE Server
- **Installation**: `npx mcp-remote <server-url>`

**Key Transport Facts:**
- **STDIO**: All clients support this for local connections
- **HTTP**: Only Claude Code CLI supports direct HTTP connections
- **SSE**: Cursor, Continue.dev, Windsurf support direct SSE connections  
- **Claude Desktop Limitation**: Cannot connect to HTTP/SSE without mcp-remote bridge

**Alternatives for Remote Access:**
- Use Claude.ai web interface for native remote server support (no mcp-remote needed)

- Follow FastMCP 2.0 patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start**:

```bash
make stop          # Stop any running processes
make clean         # Clean temporary files
make dev           # Restart
```

**Port already in use**:

```bash
lsof -i :8003      # Find what's using port 8003
make stop          # Stop MaverickMCP services
```

**Redis connection errors** (optional):

```bash
brew services start redis    # Start Redis
# Or disable caching by not setting REDIS_HOST
```

**Database errors**:

```bash
# Use SQLite (no setup required)
unset DATABASE_URL
make dev

# Or fix PostgreSQL
createdb maverick_mcp
make migrate
```

**Claude Desktop not connecting**:

1. Verify server is running: `lsof -i :8003` (check if port 8003 is in use)
2. Check `claude_desktop_config.json` syntax and correct port (8003)
3. **Use the tested SSE configuration**: `http://localhost:8003/sse` with mcp-remote
4. Restart Claude Desktop completely
5. Test with: "Get AAPL stock data"

**Tools appearing then disappearing**:

1. **FIXED**: Server now accepts both `/sse` and `/sse/` without 307 redirects
2. Use the recommended SSE configuration with mcp-remote bridge
3. Ensure you're using the exact configuration shown above
4. The SSE + mcp-remote setup has been tested and prevents tool disappearing
5. **No trailing slash required**: Server automatically handles path normalization

**Research Tool Issues**:

1. **Timeouts**: Research tools have adaptive timeouts (120s-600s)
2. Deep research may take 2-10 minutes depending on complexity
3. Monitor progress in server logs with `make tail-log`
4. Ensure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `EXA_API_KEY` are set for full functionality

**Missing S&P 500 screening data**:

```bash
# Manually seed S&P 500 database if needed
uv run python scripts/seed_sp500.py
```

### Performance Tips

- **Use Redis caching** for better performance
- **PostgreSQL over SQLite** for larger datasets
- **Parallel screening** is enabled by default (4x speedup)
- **Parallel research** achieves 7-256x speedup with agent orchestration
- **In-memory caching** reduces API calls
- **Smart model selection** reduces costs by 40-60% with OpenRouter

## Quick Testing

Test the server is working:

```bash
# Test server is running
lsof -i :8003

# Test MCP endpoint (after connecting with mcp-remote)
# Use Claude Desktop with: "List available tools"
```
